    <h1>Blockchain</h1>
    <p>A blockchain is literally a chain of blocks, but not in  the traditional sense of those words.
    We are talking about digital information ("block") being stored in a public database ("Chain")</p>
    <p>"Blocks" are made up of digital pieces of information. They have three parts: blocks store information
    about transactions, about who is participating in the transactions and blocks store information
    that distinguishes them from other blocks.</p>
    <p>When a block stores new data it is added to the blockchain. Blockchain consists of many blocks strung to
        each other. For a block to be added to a blockchain, numerous things must first occur: A transaction must
        happen, the transaction must be verified, the transaction must then be stored in a block and the block
        must be given a hash</p>

    <h1>Autonomous Things</h1>
    <p>Autonomous things is an ever-growing term for the developments in technology that are expected to bring
    computers into our physical world as autonomous entities without human instruction.</p>
    <p>Self-navigating drones are the first autonomous things technology being deployed today. It is predicted
    that the first mass production and deployment of autonomous technology will be the autonomous, or "self-driving"
    car. Companies like Telsa are leading the way in autonomous car development.</p>

    <h1>Immersive Technology</h1>
    <p>Immersive Technology involves the integration of virtual content with the physical world. Immersive technology
    enables the user to engage naturally with the virtual reality. </p>
    <p>In an immersive experience, the user accepts virtual parts of the world as part of the whole. This can 
    potentially cause them to become less conscious that the parts are not in our physical reality.</p>
    <p>Virtual reality is an ever growing immersive technology. Virtual reality is a term which describes a 3D computer
        generated environment. This environment can be explored by people.</p>
